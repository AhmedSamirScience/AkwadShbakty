# AkwadShbakty
Basically, this idea is to talk about how to make the user avoid recharge cards by reading 14 digits 
in a small font which is a problem for users especially the elderly. The app has all the codes related 
to all four communications companies like Etisalat to help the user do whatever they want like cancel call tone, 
subscribe to a specific call bundle, etc. 

Shabakty, This application collects most of the codes of the four communications companies (Orange, Vodafone, Etisalat, We) that will help the customer to get what he wants easily and he/she does not need to remember the code to complete what he/she wants. This application also helps you to charge your mobile phone using the camera. This feature is not actually supported by all mobile versions but it will be supported by all versions soon.

This project contains:
- Architecture pattern: MVVM.
- Design pattern (Creational) : Singleton - Factory. 
- Butter knife.
- Camera (Surface View).
- Covering Multi-Threading and Memory leaks problems.
- Covering The First 5 Principles of Object-Oriented Design.
- Supporting multiple screens (Available Screen Area).
